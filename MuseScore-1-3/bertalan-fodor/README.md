# openLilyLib Engraving Challenges

## Challenge #02 - Chopin/Godowsky

### LilyPond development version

This document will be the report of tackling the Chopin/Godowsky challenge
with the stable version of
[MuseScore 1.3](http://musescore.org)
I'm working on a small netbook with no mouse, so I might be slower than being on a big workstation, but that's my problem :)

#### Analysis
- The score seems somewhat complicated, so I think I will have to rely on many manual adjustments and some drawing as well
- I don't think that the nonstandard beaming is supported by MuseScore. First I will create that before the full raw note entry, as first I want to know how I'll do that.
The solution can affect how I typeset the raw notes.
