### Chopin/Godowsky study

[![](chopin-godowsky-small.png)](chopin-godowsky.png)

As the idea for the **_Scores of Beauty_ Engraving Challenges** arose from engraving complex
late-romantic piano music it seemed natural to start with such a challenge.
We found something which we found ideal:
[Leopold Godowsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky)'s
arrangements of Schubert songs, a music that is flourishing with wonderful polyphonic
additions and inventions - and an engraver's nightmare ;-)
The issue is that - although Godowsky died more than 70 years ago, giving his music
to the public domain in most countries - these pieces have been published in the U.S.
less than 90 years ago ...

After some pondering I recalled the five volumes of Godowksy's "Studies on Chopin's studies"
that I own but (as a pianist) never dared to touch so far. These pieces have been published
in Germany, so they are actually free to use (because there isn't such a long time protection
regarding the *publication* date in the EU).  
Surprisingly, most of them are quite simple notation-wise, but I think I found one nice example
that would be a challenging task: a page from the study on Chopin's study in a minor op. 25/11.
You'll find it in the [PNG file](chopin-godowsky.png) in this directory.

Please remember: this is a challenge and only partly a contest. There is no deadline.
The point is to try creating the most beautiful engraving with notation package of your choice,
and document your progress on your way there.
